Simple Chess AI Game

This is a personal project to make a simple but working chess playing bot. My goal is for my bot to be able to play chess at a competent level
against mediocre opponents, such as myself. Eventually I would like to extend this foundation to make a chess playing bot that can compete
against very good opponents and even one that uses machine learning to evaluate game states quickly.
